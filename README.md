p2pFileSharingSystem
====================

a p2p file sharing system in java, for the school project.

This was a school project under course named "Distributed System" in late 2013. 
The project lasts for 4 monthes and requirements were added little by little.
this is the final version, which includes RMI, sockect, multiThreading, and file I/O.
this design allows user to config Pull or Push in terms of file consistency, simplify it, 
when some node modify the file, how will other node containing the file react.
for demostration, I also put some script file and manual because it not a regualer program,
it needs to open up rmi service.
